Selected Work and Code Projects

Encompasses a diverse set of many of the projects that were created during school and post school work - 
SAS was primarily tool used during graduate school work, but R and Google Scripts, as the free open source tools, have been used more recently utilized. 

Much of the SQL code I have available and published has been embedded within SAS projects and  PROC SQL SAS statements. 
Note the names of the files that has SQL significant coding in them. SQLite was used substantially to manipulate the provided raw fire data, but size limitations restricted adding db.
